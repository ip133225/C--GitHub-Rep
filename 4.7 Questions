1. What kinds of things would be difficult to program without loops? 
     Without loops it would be difficult to code because it may possibly have an animation delay, memory may be lost, and it is more
     difficult to read.
 
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of switch statements?
     Some advantages and disadvantages of switch statements are its easier to debug, easier for a person to read, easier to understand, and
     easier to maintain. A sequence of if else if statements may yield deep nesting, making compilation more difficult, potentially faster
     execution, easier to verify that all values are handled.
    
3. When should you use a while loop over a do loop?
     You should use a while loop over a do loop when you want to repeat a section of code a number of times until a specific condition or 
     your preference is met.     
     
4. Describe your favorite game in terms of the game loop. Is the game loop a good fit?
      My favorite game in terms of a game loop is Pac-Man because when I die it ask "Would you like to play again" and I could choose 
      between choice 1: Yes or choice 2: No.
